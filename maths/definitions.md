## Function
In mathematics, a function from a set X to a set Y assigns to each element of X exactly one element of Y. The set X is called the domain of the function and the set Y is called the codomain of the function. A function is uniquely represented by the set of all pairs (x, f (x)), called the graph of the function.

Informally, each input has one and only one output.

If an element of the domain is mapped to more than one element of the codomain, it is not a function. E.g. a vertical line is not a function.

## Inverse function
 the inverse function of a function f (also called the inverse of f) is a function that undoes the operation of f. The inverse of f exists if and only if f is bijective, and if it exists, is denoted by f⁻¹.

## Logarithm
The logarithm is the inverse function to exponentiation. That means the logarithm of a given number x is the exponent to which another fixed number, the base b, must be raised, to produce that number x. In the simplest case, the logarithm counts the number of occurrences of the same factor in repeated multiplication; e.g. since 1000 = 10x10x10 = 10^3, the "logarithm base 10" of 1000 is 3, or log10(1000) = 3. The logarithm of x to base b is denoted as logb(x), or without parentheses, logb x, or even without the explicit base, log x, when no confusion is possible, or when the base does not matter such as in big O notation.

that the logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms of the factors

Logarithmic scales reduce wide-ranging quantities to smaller scopes.
