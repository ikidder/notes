When Amazon.com launched in 1995, it was with the mission “to be Earth’s most customer-centric company.”

You'll also hear us say that at Amazon, it's always "Day 1." What do we mean? Our approach remains the same as it was on Amazon’s very first day — to make smart, fast decisions, stay nimble, innovate and invent, and focus on delighting customers.
