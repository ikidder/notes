    "## Use Cases\n",
    "* _Heapsort_: One of the best sorting methods being in-place and with no quadratic worst-case scenarios.\n",
    "* _Selection algorithms_: A heap allows access to the min or max element in constant time, and other selections (such as median or kth-element) can be done in sub-linear time on data that is in a heap.[19]\n",
    "* _Graph algorithms_: By using heaps as internal traversal data structures, run time will be reduced by polynomial order. Examples of such problems are Prim's minimal-spanning-tree algorithm and Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm.\n",
    "* _Priority Queue_: A priority queue is an abstract concept like \"a list\" or \"a map\"; just as a list can be implemented with a linked list or an array, a priority queue can be implemented with a heap or a variety of other methods.\n",
    "* _K-way merge_: A heap data structure is useful to merge many already-sorted input streams into a single sorted output stream. Examples of the need for merging include external sorting and streaming results from distributed data such as a log structured merge tree. The inner loop is obtaining the min element, replacing with the next element for the corresponding input stream, then doing a sift-down heap operation. (Alternatively the replace function.) (Using extract-max and insert functions of a priority queue are much less efficient.)\n",
    "* _Order statistics_: The Heap data structure can be used to efficiently find the kth smallest (or largest) element in an array."
