    "\n",
    "Binary search is an example of an ùòñ(log n) problem. To locate a person `p` in a telephone book containing `n` names, start by comparing `p` against the middle (`n/2`) name. After just one comparison, you can discard half the names from consideration. The number of steps the algorithm takes is the number of time we can halve n until only one name is left. By definition, this is exactly `log‚ÇÇ n`.\n",

    "There are two bit patterns of length 1: 0 and 1. There are four bit patterns of length 2: 00, 01, 10, 11. How many bits `w` do we need to represent any one of `n`? The key observation is that there must be at least `n` different bit patterns of length `w`. Since the number of different bit patterns doubles as you add each bit, we need at least `` bits where `2^w = n` In other words, we need `w = log‚ÇÇ n`."
