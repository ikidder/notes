* constant f(n) == 1: cost of adding two numbers, or printing out a string. No dependence on n.
* logarithmic f(n) == log n: grows, but quite slowly. binary search.
* linear f(n) == n: cost of looking at each item once in an n-element array.
* superlinear f(n) == n lg n: grow just a little faster than linear. quicksort and mergesort.
* quadratic f(n) == n^2: cost of looking at the pairs of elements. insertion sort. selection sort.
* cubic f(n) == n^3: cost of looking at the triples of elements. certain dynamic programming problems.
* exponential f(n) == x^n, cost of looking at subsets of elements
factorial f(n) == n!: cost of looking at permutations of elements
