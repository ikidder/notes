    "## Adapter\n",
    "> The adapter design pattern applies to any context where we effectively want to modify an existing class so that its methods match those of a related, but different, class or interface. One general way to apply the adapter pattern is to define a new class in such a way that it contains an instance of the existing class as a hidden field, and then to implement each method of the new class using methods of this hidden instance variable.\n",
