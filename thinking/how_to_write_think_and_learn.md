# How to Write More Clearly, Think More Clearly, and Learn Complex Material More Easily

Central claim:
* Write more clearly
* Think more clearly
* Learn more easily

These are connected!


# How to write more clearly

## why
* You don't know what you know until you try to express it.
* Clear thinking leads to clear writing.
* If your writing is nonsense, maybe your thinking is, too.
* People who write are powerful. You influence other people by writing things for them to read.

## how
* good writing is partly a matter of character
* Instead of doing what's easy for you, do what's easy for your reader.
* I'm not giving this presentation because I'm important, but because you're important.
* I'm not going to demand that you put up with my quirks.
* I'm going to package the information so that it enters your head as easily as possible.

## process
Writing is almost too complicated for humans. We have to break up the process of writing to make it possible.

1. planning - deciding what and how to write
2. drafting - getting it on paper _once_
3. revising - getting it on paper _better_
4. editing - fixing spelling, grammar, typing, etc.
5. formatting - choosing typefaces, layout, etc

### planning
* why am I writing this?
* who is the audience?
* what does the audience know/expect/want?
* how can i organize it?
* what are the format and style requirements?

If you can't figure out how to organize, write down ideas in random order, then sort them.

You don't have to write sections in linear order. Try writing the introduction last. 

### drafting
get it down on paper. doesn't have to be good. but it does have to **get to the point**. Because your reader doesn't want to follow you down a path.

State the main point before giving the reasoning for it.

Put the main point of each paragraph in the first sentence.

K.I.S.S - keep it simple, stupid. Use the clearest, simplest language that will do the job.

### revising
the goal of this step is to make the writing more clear and easier to read.

be critical. if something can be misunderstood, change it.

remove needless words. all of them.

### editing

### formatting
* keep it simple
* keep it standard
* avoid meaningless variation

Never draw the eye to anything other than a main point.


# how to think more clearly
* language
* logic
* epistemology

## language

you should know whether you know what your words mean. don't get used to putting words together in unfamiliar ways without understanding them. 

How do you know what a sentence means? Largely, but know how to find out if it is true or false. The test may be impossible to perform, but you should know what the test would be. Example: "All dogs are brown". That sentence can be proved true by looking at all the dogs in the world. 

## logic
* some sentences can't be proved true or false by physical tests. "Murder is wrong".
* some sentences are meaningless. "There are invisible, undetectable elves all over this room". 

## epistemology
the study of how to acquire knowledge by studying the world around you. The goal is to end up believing things that are true, and not believing things that are false.

### how to form beliefs based on evidence
1. hypothesis
2. try to prove
3. try to disprove

### stages of belief
1. conjecture or guess
2. opinion; supported by some evidence
3. belief; thoroughly tested by evidence

**A belief isn't warranted unless you could have knows if it's not true**. From Karl Popper.

# How to learn complex material more easily

1. Have goals and adjust them often
2. Use a suitable learning strategy
3. Insist on clear understanding
4. Organize the knowledge for yourself

## have goals and adjust them often
You have to want to learn something, and have some idea what it is. As your get a better understanding of what it is, your goal can change.

## learning strategy

when students find a subject extrememly hard, they are probably using the wrong learning strategy.

Different kinds of material require different learning strategies.

A student who is only good at one subject is often someone who has only one learning strategy.


### learning strategy for maths
* main goal is clear understanding of key points.
* important ideas are not so much learned as rediscovered.
* trace ideas to their sources (who discovered them)
* you must take things in order

## learning strategy for engineering or computer science
* main goal is to apply science to solve problems
* easy to experiment to see if your solutions work
* you must learn things in order
* no need to trace ideas to their sources and see who discovered them
* tendency to follow authorities blindly

## clear understanding
**Insist on clear understanding**. My C and D students are so used to be confused, that they don't realize it isn't normal.

Learn the vocab. Be precise.  
(If you don't, you can't learn anything else.)

If something is unclear, don't wait until later. Back up and make it clear.

If you guess anything, you must test your guess immediately.

## Organizing knowledge
Don't expect the textbook or teach to organize the contents of your head for you. 

**Organize the knowledge for yourself**. Make your own notes. Pretend your writing a textbook. Constantly check your own understanding in as many ways as you can.

**Learning is a lot like writing a book.** The goal is to build a structure in your own mind, not to absorb something someone else gave you.
